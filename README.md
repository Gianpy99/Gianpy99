### 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a hands-on engineer passionate about building test automation pipelines, embedded systems, and scalable development environments. I love turning LEGO bricks, Raspberry Pis, and CI/CD tools into real-world validation platforms.

- 🔍 Focused on **HIL testing**, **DevOps for embedded**, and **automation**
- 🧰 Tools I work with: Python, Docker, Jenkins, Raspberry Pi, REST APIs, CAN tools
- 🎯 Currently building: a fully automated CI/CD test platform for LEGO Technic Hubs
