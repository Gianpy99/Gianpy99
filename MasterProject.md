# 🚀 Project Board Template (GitHub Projects)

This template helps organize development workflow for solo projects.  
Use it either **per repository** or as a **master project** across all apps.

---

## 📌 Columns (Kanban)

1. **Backlog / Ideas**
   - Raw ideas, potential features, experiments.
   - Example: "Add leaderboard to kids game"

2. **Planned**
   - Refined scope, defined MVP features.
   - Example: "Define MVP features for monitoring tool"

3. **Design**
   - Wireframes, architecture, technical decisions.
   - Example: "Decide DB schema for sensor logs"

4. **In Progress**
   - Actively coding or implementing.
   - Example: "Implement login system"

5. **Testing**
   - Bug fixing, validation, user testing.
   - Example: "Test game loop on iPad"

6. **Polish**
   - UI/UX improvements, optimizations, docs.
   - Example: "Improve animations and add sound effects"

7. **Released**
   - Completed, deployed, or delivered features.
   - Example: "Web app v1.0 live"

## 🏷️ Suggested Labels

- `MVP` → Must-have for first release  
- `Bug` → Fix required  
- `Enhancement` → Nice-to-have improvement  
- `Experiment` → Trying out an idea  
- `Docs` → Documentation-related  

---

## 🎯 Milestones

- **MVP v1.0** → Core usable version  
- **Polished v1.1** → Extra features, UX refinements  
- **Future v2.0** → Bigger roadmap items  

---

## 🌍 Master Project (Tracking All Apps)

If you want a **single master project** across all repos:
- Create a **new Project** at your GitHub **profile or organization level** (not just inside one repo).
- Use the *same column structure* as above.
- Add cards for each app, such as:
  - **Kids Game**
    - MVP → In Progress
    - Next features → Backlog
  - **Monitoring Tool**
    - MVP → Released
    - Bug fix → Testing
  - **Web App**
    - MVP → Planned

This way you can see **all your apps in one board**.

---

## ✅ Daily Workflow

1. Add new tasks/ideas to **Backlog**.  
2. Move selected items to **Planned** → **In Progress**.  
3. Test → Polish → Released.  
4. Always keep the board updated (this becomes your dev log).
